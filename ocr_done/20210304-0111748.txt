A Recent Review
"I was blessed this season in finding this
gem of a shop that repaired my 2012
Mini. The shop was clean and organized
and owner, Billy, explained exactly what
the problem was, how it was going to be
repaired, and the cost. He also looked
at another older car / had and helped
solve an issue / had with that one. / have
recommended him to my friends that
own BMWs and Minis with no hesitation.
Thank you again Billy."
