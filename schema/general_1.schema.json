		"Mailing Type": { "type": "string", "description": "The marketing classification used to describe the communication. Acquisition: The piece offers a new product or service to a consumer who is not a current customer of the company that is making the offer. Acquisition Mailing is the default mailing type for a media piece that is trying to acquire a new customer. \n\nAlert: The piece offers information about the customer’s account.  Alerts are typically set up by the customer and are triggered by behavior such as an account withdrawal or a deposit.  For example, a customer may request an alert when an account balance falls below a certain dollar amount or when a bill is due to be paid. The mailing type for Statement Alerts should be captured as Statement.   If a mailing contains the word alert and is only being used for marketing purposes, (for example, ALERT:  Sale ends Saturday), the mailing would not be considered an alert mailing. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. Payment confirmations and reminders of upcoming payment due dates would be considered Alert. \n\nCross Sell (Retention): The piece offers a new product or service to a current customer of the company that is making the offer.  The new product or service should be offered in addition to the current product or service and not replace the current product or service. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. Pay-Per-view pieces, such as advertisements for boxing or MMA matches, would be considered Cross-Sell. \n\nFollow Up (Acquisition): The piece offers another chance for the consumer, who is not a current customer of the company that is making the offer, to respond to an acquisition offer that was made in the recent past. Phrasing such as Last chance or Final offer alone does not indicate a Follow Up mailing.  The piece needs to be explicit and reference previous attempts at contacting the prospect. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nFollow Up (Retention): The piece offers another chance for the consumer, who is a current customer of the company that is making the offer, to respond to a retention offer that was made in the recent past. Phrasing such as Last Chance or Final Offer alone does not indicate a Follow Up mailing.  The piece needs to be explicit and reference previous attempts at contacting the prospect. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nInformational: The piece provides current customers with information about their account or the institution that services the account.  This information might be in the form of a privacy policy, merger information, or other general account information. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nLoyalty: The piece offers existing customers additional ways to access their account, discounts or benefits for utilizing their account, or any other incentives that may entice the customer to utilize the account. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. Any piece that is branded as being from a loyalty program (Mileage Plus, AAdvantage, etc) should be captured as Loyalty. VIP Guest Rewards linked to Priority Rewards should be captured as Loyalty. \n\nPhishing (Security): This piece is a form of identity theft that entices a consumer to disclose account information by posing as a company that the consumer does business with.  Generally these emails have some or all of the following characteristics:  Sender’s email address appears unofficial; Greeting is generic such as Dear User or Dear Customer; False sense of urgency such as Account will be deactivated with in 24 hours; Links provided send the user to a fraudulent site; Poor English and grammar. Due to the nature of Phishing, the characteristics are constantly changing and evolving this will cause the common characteristics to be updated often. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nRenewal (Retention): The piece offers the opportunity to renew an account that is going to expire.  This would include accounts such as a AAA membership, an insurance policy, etc. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nStatement: The piece includes an account statement and possibly inserts for additional offers. In the email channel, the mailing type for Statement Alerts should be captured as Statement.   If the email contains the word Alert and is only being used for marketing purposes, (for example ALERT:  Sale ends Saturday), the mailing would not be considered an alert mailing. Mailings that only include a notice that a statement is ready for on-line view should be classified as statement mailings, even though the entire statement is not included in the mailing. Mailing for viewing of an e-bill would also fall into the Statement category.  If the mailing could be both a Statement mailing and a Cross-Sell mailing, Statement should be selected.  If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nUpgrade (Retention): The piece offers the opportunity to upgrade the status of a current product or service. If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type. \n\nWelcome Communications: The piece contains onboarding information for new users and acknowledges them for being a new customer. \n\nWin Back: The piece offers the opportunity to re-open a closed account or return to a provider that the consumer has worked with in the past.  If a piece can be classified under more than one mailing type in addition to Upgrade (Retention), then Upgrade (Retention) should be selected as the mailing type.", "enum": ["Acquisition", "Alert", "Cross Sell (Retention)", "Follow Up (Acquisition)", "Follow Up (Retention)", "Informational", "Loyalty", "Phishing", "Renewal (Retention)", "Statement", "Upgrade (Retention)", "Welcome Communication", "Win Back"]},
